  im all alone out here in Germany on my year abroad, with only 2 months left to go...
  and he dumps me now. \r\nits so ridiculous, and im so upset. it was getting easier,
  but all of a sudden i dont seem to be able to deal with it now.\r\nim suddenly so
  depressed, and overeating, and i cant stop myself. Why hasn't he text me? how can
  i be that bad a person that I deserve to be treated like this?\r\ni am so sad. so
  alone. Richard... i hate you for doing this to me... just when things were going
  so right for me. I can't do my work.. I don't even wanna live right now. You are
  so cruel."

  never tell him.
'915855005': I dumped my ex boyfriend because I didn't like his attitudes about sex.  However,
  if I could fuck just one person right now, dear God, it would be him.
'469277939': I'm sick of men being shallow assholes and I don't want to date them.
'442490892': I still want my co-worker even though he's married and is 20 years older
  than me.  The thing is, we flirt back and forth so I know the feeling's mutual.  He
  is so sexy and we get along so well!  I can't wait until his wife leaves town and/or
  until we get the chance to go out for drinks...  I want him so bad and it's only
  a matter of time until I have him...

'576757781': ! "Tomorrow she will ask me why I left her sleeping alone, passed out
  from gin and fully clothed without a warm body to hold when she wakes, and I won√¢\x80\x99t
  tell her that it could have been the first time for her to see me cry if she had
  seen me ten minutes ago.  If she had seen what I saw, if she had seen what I had
  to destroy, she would understand.  She would have seen a body as warm and alive
  as a tender child, chest heaving in and out slowly with flesh peaceful and subsisting.
  \ She would have seen a soft body that will be made to shudder violently with painful
  tears.  She would have seen the tits that will be clenched and cradled when the
  body that contains them is left abandoned and alone.  If she had seen what I saw,
  she would have cried, too, because I will never love her."
